# Time Series Analysis of the Evolution of Brazilian Electric Energy between 2000 and 2020

  A country's energy capacity is vital for a country's economic growth. In a world with ever-increasing energy demand, each country will need to expand its energy matrix - especially electricity - on an ongoing basis. However, measures to contain Global Warming are increasing, trying to minimize the emission of polluting gases. In this way, the expansion of the electricity matrix of each country must use, preferably, renewable and low-polluting sources to guarantee a better world for the next generations.

  Brazil is known worldwide for its great diversity and prevalence of natural resources, which allows its electrical matrix to have a substantial predominance of renewable sources. However, the growing energy demand has caused problems in guaranteeing the energy supply to the population, which may worsen in the future. Therefore, this work aims to evaluate the growth of Brazilian electricity between 2000 and 2020 based on energy data dispatched in the SIN (National Interconnected System).

  This project has two main objectives:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the dataset, with a greater focus on Total Energy Dispatched from energy;
- Creation of a predictive model of the behavior of Total Energy using the SARIMA model.

## Stacks
- Language: Python;
- Model Creation - Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels, Scikit-learn

## Conclusion

 In this project:

- Data was obtained through the Open Data provided by the Federal Government, its treatment and manipulation, which facilitated the subsequent analysis.
- The reasons that caused the behavior of the different variables in the Exploratory Data Analysis were discussed, showing the impact of government policies and environmental and economic crises on energy production.
- It concluded that Brazilian Electricity saw an expansion in the use of Renewable Energies that are not of water origin, which minimizes greenhouse gas emissions and reduces the effect that a water crisis can cause in the supply of energy to the population. However, this policy can generate impacts due to the increase in the use of intermittent sources in the Electric Matrix;
- An analysis of the Time Series of Total Dispatched Energy was made, decomposing its components and a predictive model was created for its behavior in the next 12 months.
